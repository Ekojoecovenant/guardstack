# 🛡️ DevGuard

> Catch broken configs before they break your app.

DevGuard is a fast, zero-config `.env` scanner for Node.js projects. It validates your environment variables and warns you about weak secrets, invalid ports, malformed URLs, and empty values — before you ship.

Built with Rust. Fast by default.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 Scans your `.env` file instantly
- ❌ Detects weak secrets (e.g. `JWT_SECRET` too short)
- ❌ Catches invalid port values (e.g. `PORT=abc`)
- ❌ Flags malformed URLs (e.g. `DATABASE_URL=localhost`)
- ⚠️ Warns about empty or malformed variables
- ✅ Clean, readable CLI output

---

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
npx @deveko/devguard
```

That's it. No installation needed.

---

## 📦 Usage

Place a `.env` file in your project root, then run:

```bash
# Scan default .env
npx @deveko/devguard check
 
# Scan a custom path
npx @deveko/devguard check --path ./apps/backend/.env
```

### Example `.env`

```env
TEST2
PORT=abc
JWT_SECRET=123
DATABASE_URL=localhost
NODE_ENV=development
```

### Example output

```bash
🔍 DevGuard - scanning .env...

⚠️ 'TEST2' is malformed - missing '='
❌ PORT -> must be a number
❌ JWT_SECRET -> must be greater than or equal to 32 characters
❌ DATABASE_URL -> must start with http://, https://, postgres://, postgresql://, mysql://, redis://, rediss://, mongodb://, mongodb+srv://, amqp://, amqps://, sqlite://

⚠️  3 errors(s) and 1 warning(s) found
```

When everything looks good:

```bash
🔍 DevGuard - scanning .env...

✅ All checks passed! Your .env looks good!
```

---

## 🧠 How It Works

DevGuard scans your `.env` file line by line and runs pattern-based validation rules:

| Pattern | Rule |
| ------- | ---- |
| Key contains `SECRET` | Value must be ≥ 32 characters |
| Key contains `PORT` | Value must be a valid number |
| Key contains `URL` | Value must start with a valid protocol |

No config needed. Just run it.
